Everything is not right, everything is wrong, you are my friend, I am your enemy
How is everything with you and me?
It was April, and we swore in love, but alas
A yellow leaf flew through the boulevards of Moscow

The third of September is the day of farewell
The day the mountain ash fires burn
Promises burn like bonfires
On a day when I'm all alone

I will turn the calendar over - and again the third of September
I'll take a look at your photo - and again on the third of September
But why, but why did we have to part?
After all, we had everything in earnest on the second of September
But why, but why did we have to part?
After all, we had everything in earnest on the second of September

White wedge crane, your daughter and my son
Everyone wants warmth and affection
We're in love, like a game in the cold wind
Played with you, but came by itself

The third of September is the day of farewell
The day the mountain ash fires burn
Promises burn like bonfires
On a day when I'm all alone

I will turn the calendar over - and again the third of September
I'll take a look at your photo - and again on the third of September
But why, but why did we have to part?
After all, we had everything in earnest on the second of September
But why, but why did we have to part?
After all, we had everything in earnest on the second of September
