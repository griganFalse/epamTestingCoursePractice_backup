Everything is not right, everything is wrong, you are my friend, I am your enemy
How is everything with you and me?
It was April, and we swore in love, but alas
A yellow leaf flew through the boulevards of Moscow

The third of September is the day of farewell
The day the mountain ash fires burn
Promises burn like bonfires
On a day when I'm all alone
